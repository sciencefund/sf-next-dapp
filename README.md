# HardHard Backend

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:
```
npx hardhat help

```
### deploy to local network
```shell
npx hardhat clean
TS_NODE_TRANSPILE_ONLY=1 npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat deploy
```

### Running test
more tests are needed

```shell
npx hardhat test
```
